<p class="text-nowrap">It wasn’t until the beginning of 1935 that a polymer called "polymer 6-6" was finally produced. The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced by Wallace Carothers on February 28, 1935, at DuPont's research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station.[7] It had all the desired properties of elasticity and strength. However, it also required a complex manufacturing process that would become the basis of industrial production in the future. DuPont obtained a patent for the polymer in September 1938,[19] and quickly achieved a monopoly of the fiber.[17] Carothers died 16 months before the announcement of nylon, therefore he was never able to see his success. </p>
